public class GitHub {
    //Git - the software that runs on the computer
    //      (free)
    //GitHub - manages multiple people interacting over the cloud
    //      (free with more features that cost $$$ [mostly free though])

    //Important GitHub commands:
    //  Branch - Split off from the main branch and continue separate development
    //  Merge - Connects branches together
    //  Clone - Makes a deep copy of code; changes you make will not change the original & changes to the original will not change yours
    //  Commit - When your changes are uploaded and made official

    //Pretty much everyone (except for the military) uses GitHub

    //Think of a GitHub 'repo' (repository) as a directory / folder that contains
    //other folders that contain source code (and other things)
